# üóìÔ∏è Event Logger

## **Seamless Event Tracking for Your Next Big Thing**

The **Event Logger** is a full-stack application designed to effortlessly capture, store, and display upcoming events. Built on the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), it provides a modern, responsive interface for users to log, view, and manage important dates and activities, ensuring nothing falls through the cracks.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Full MERN Stack:** Utilizes **MongoDB** for flexible data storage, **Express** and **Node.js** for a robust backend API, and **React** for a dynamic, single-page application frontend.
* **Seamless Logging:** Easily submit new events with key details like title, date, and description.
* **Interactive Event List:** View all logged events in a clean, user-friendly interface.
* **Scalable Architecture:** Modular design allows for easy extension, such as adding user authentication or recurring events.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a development copy of the project running on your local machine.

### **Prerequisites**

You will need the following installed:

* **Node.js** (v18+ recommended)
* **npm** (comes bundled with Node.js)
* **MongoDB** (running locally or a connection string for a cloud service like Atlas)

### **Installation**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/event-logger-repo](https://github.com/your-username/event-logger-repo)
    cd event-logger-repo
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies for both the client and server:**
    ```bash
    # Install root and server dependencies
    npm install
    
    # Change into the client directory and install client dependencies
    cd client
    npm install
    cd ..
    ```

### **Configuration**

You need to configure the database connection and the server port.

1.  Create a file named **`.env`** in the root directory (`/event-logger-repo`).
2.  Add your environment variables:

    ```env
    # MongoDB connection string (e.g., local or Atlas)
    MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/eventdb
    
    # Port for the Express server to run on (e.g., 5000)
    PORT=5000
    ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Running the Application

The MERN stack requires a build step and running both the compiled frontend and the Node.js backend.

1.  **Build the React Frontend:**
    This command compiles the React code and places the production assets in the `/client/build` directory, which the Express server will then serve.

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

2.  **Start the Full-Stack Application:**
    This command starts the Express server, which connects to MongoDB and serves the built React application.

    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```

The application will now be running, typically accessible at:
$$\text{http://localhost}:\mathbf{5000}$$
